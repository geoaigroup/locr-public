LOCR platform serves to collect and analyze road crash events using crowd-sourcing approach from social media (notably Twitter and Facebook).  

Developed by a group led by Dr Ali J. Ghandour, LOCR has been in production since 2015 at the National Center for Remote Sensing â€“ CNRS.  

LOCR is the only real-time and openly available Lebanese spatio-temporal road crashes database. Events collection, classification and visualization is done autonomously, without any human intervention, by employing Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Fine-grained data and comprehensive reporting is not the objective of this work, but rather LOCR serves to mine and analyze spatio-temporal road crashes trends using representative time-series.  

The data collected from this work has proven itself to be credible and has been used in multiple research projects so far [[LINK]](https://geogroup.ai/project/locr/).  

[[SLIDES]](https://geogroup.ai/project/locr/LOCR_latest.pdf) that summarizes major milestones and achievements as part of the LOCR project.

ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰ <b>"Trend Analysis of Lebanese Road Crashes in 2022"</b> has been released [[Report]](https://geogroup.ai/project/locr/RoadCrashesReport2022.pdf).
